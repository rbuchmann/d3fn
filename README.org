* D3FN

This library provides a functional wrapper around the wonderful but
very state oriented d3 library. It's a work in progress and expected
to change a lot. Contributions are welcome.

* How to run

The development setup is based on devcards, so you can just run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein figwheel devcards
#+END_SRC

and then navigate to localhost:3449/cards.html.
